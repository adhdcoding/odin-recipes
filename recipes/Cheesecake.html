    <h2>A creamy and tasty cheesecake</h2>
    <p>I tend to make a larger cheesecake using twice the amount of  Ingredients</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>175g Biscoff Caramelised Biscuits</li>
      <li>100g unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>200g bar Waitrose Belgian White Chocolate, broken into squares</li>
      <li>400g Soft Cheese</li>
      <li>25g caster sugar</li>
      <li>75ml double cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put the biscuits in a large plastic food bag and crush with a rolling
        pin until finely ground. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the butter. Tip
        into a 20cm loose-based round cake tin with a depth of about 4cm. Use
        the back of a teaspoon to pack the mixture in a thin layer around the
        sides of the tin then press the remainder over the base then place in
        fridge to chill while preparing the filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, either over a pan of hot water
        (making sure the base doesn't touch the water) or in the microwave in
        short spurts. Stir frequently so the chocolate melts evenly. Beat the
        soft cheese in a separate bowl with the sugar and 2 tbsp boiling water
        until smooth. Beat in the chocolate and the double cream. Spoon into the
        tin and spread in an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk the remaining cream until just holding its shape then spread it
        over the filling. Chill for at least 3 hours before removing from the
        tin.
